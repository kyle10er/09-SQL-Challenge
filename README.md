# 09-SQL-Challenge
SQL Challenge for UPENN bootcamp

This repository was created to address the challenge 09_SQL.  Using QuickDB I created the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) required to construct the schemata of the database.  From here I imported the data frmo the provided CSV files so that I could select the required information.  This code was created using past samples from module 9 and with guidance of CHATGPT 3.5 to check syntax errors.

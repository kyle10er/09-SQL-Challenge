# 09-SQL-Challenge
SQL Challenge for UPENN bootcamp

This repository was created to address the challenge 09_SQL. This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. First, for the data modeling we were tasked with creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with the prodided CSV files. Second, for the data engineering, was to use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files provided.  Lastly, for the data analysis, we were tasked with performing different queries of the information in PostgreSQL 4 to show our grasp of SQL.   

The SQL code was written in PostgreSQL and the ERD was created using QuickDB.
